# Start Working on a Ticket

### For every ticket
- assign yourself
- add this sprint's label

### Is there QA on the ticket?
- If there is, the moment i understand the ticket, ping QA
- She wants a meeting, say "yo, let's chat for fifteen about my understaanding of the ticket"

### Create and Checkout new branch for your issue 
git-worktree-add [ticketNumber]-[ticketTitle]
e.g.
```
git-worktree-add 563-ec2-iam-docker infra
```

### create a draft PR so team can follow my ticket
I have a reminder in my daily planner, but this is just important to remember
