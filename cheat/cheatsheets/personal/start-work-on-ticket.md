# Start Working on a Ticket
## check this useful new dev agreement
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwZIF_lydPWfvixxZlQLNt4nqy3Qp13pHQnMcYJjTqE/edit

my summary below:
pick up ticket
understand/research ticket (can include testing elsewhere)
talk to QA - we get on the same page
do whatever work you need to do
if we didn't talk earlier, we absolutely need to talk before you open that PR, draft is fine
Normally deploy branch to dev and test your branch, can't do that here > Dev Testing
When satisfied that thing works on dev (can't do that here), open the PR > Dev Testing
make sure my branch is updated


### For every ticket
- assign yourself
- add this sprint's label

### Is there QA on the ticket?
- If there is, the moment i understand the ticket, ping QA
- She wants a meeting, say "yo, let's chat for fifteen about my understaanding of the ticket"

### Create and Checkout new branch for your issue 
git-worktree-add [ticketNumber]-[ticketTitle]
e.g.
```
git-worktree-add 563-ec2-iam-docker infra
```

### create a draft PR so team can follow my ticket
I have a reminder in my daily planner, but this is just important to remember
