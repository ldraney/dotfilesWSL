pick up ticket
understand/research ticket (can include testing elsewhere)
talk to QA - we get on the same page
do whatever work you need to do
if we didn't talk earlier, we absolutely need to talk before you open that PR, draft is fine
Normally deploy branch to dev and test your branch, can't do that here > Dev Testing
When satisfied that thing works on dev (can't do that here), open the PR > Dev Testing
make sure my branch is updated


# Opening a PR
