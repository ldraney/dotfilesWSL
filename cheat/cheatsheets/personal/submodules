git submodule update --init --recursive


If you make a change in a submodule, its important you make a branch for that change, push, and then merge.  submodule changes are not saved in the main modules history!

It looks like you're setting up several personal repositories and you want help setting up a submodule for the `kickstart.nvim` repository within your `dotfilesWSL` repository. I can help you with that!

To add `kickstart.nvim` as a submodule to your `dotfilesWSL` repository, you'll follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your `dotfilesWSL` Repository Directory:**
   Ensure you're inside the `dotfilesWSL` repository directory. If you've just cloned it, you might already be there. If not, you need to `cd` into it.

   ```bash
   cd $HOME/personal/dotfilesWSL
   ```

2. **Add the Submodule:**
   Use the `git submodule add` command to add your `kickstart.nvim` repository as a submodule. You can specify the directory where the submodule should be placed. For example, if you want it in a directory named `kickstart.nvim` within the `dotfilesWSL` repository, you would do the following:

   ```bash
   git submodule add git@github.com:ldraney/kickstart.nvim.git kickstart.nvim
   ```

3. **Initialize and Update the Submodule:**
   After adding the submodule, you need to initialize and update it to ensure that the files are checked out:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

4. **Commit the Changes:**
   Adding a submodule will change the `.gitmodules` file and add a new directory for the submodule. You'll need to commit these changes:

   ```bash
   git add .gitmodules kickstart.nvim
   git commit -m "Added kickstart.nvim submodule"
   ```

5. **Push the Changes:**
   Finally, push the changes to your remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

By following these steps, you will successfully add the `kickstart.nvim` repository as a submodule to your `dotfilesWSL` repository. This allows you to keep your `kickstart.nvim` repository updates separate but still integrated within your dotfiles setup.
